## Why do you think we use `const` instead of `let` for the button variable?

- The reference to the DOM element shouldn't change.
- Prevents accidental reassignment bugs.
- Shows other developers this is a "fixed" reference.

> **Great thinking ahead about potential errors! 👏**

## What does the `() => {}` syntax mean? (This is called an arrow function)

- `() => {}` is indeed an **arrow function**.
- You correctly identified it as a **callback function**.
- Great connection to array methods like `map()` and `forEach()`.
- This shows you understand the **function-as-argument** concept!

## Why did you choose `console.log()` instead of `alert()`?  
*(Both would work, but one is better for debugging)*

- `console.log()` is better for ongoing development and debugging.
- `alert()` can be useful for quick checks but interrupts user flow.
- The console gives you more detailed information and history.

> **You're developing good debugging habits early! 🎯**
