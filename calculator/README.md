## 💡 Pro Tips for Learners

> 🎯 **Start Small, Think Big**: Begin with basic arithmetic, then gradually add features. Each enhancement teaches new concepts.

> 🔄 **Refactor Regularly**: As you learn new patterns, revisit earlier code. This reinforces learning and improves code quality.

> 🧪 **Test Everything**: Write tests for each feature. It prevents bugs and teaches you to think about edge cases.

> 📚 **Document Your Journey**: Keep notes about what you learned. It helps with retention and creates a valuable reference.
